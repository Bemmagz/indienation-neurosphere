# NeuroSphere: The Living Value Identity Ecosystem
**Version:** 1.0 (Quantum-Ready)
**Founder:** [Authorized Access Only]
**Status:** Operational - v2.6.6

---

## 1. Executive Summary
NeuroSphere is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a **Language of Value**. It unifies digital assets into a single logical identity called **Technology Money (TM)**. By integrating Artificial Regenerative General Intelligence (ARGI), NeuroSphere ensures a self-healing, post-quantum economic environment for 20 sovereign nations.

## 2. The Triple-Asset Architecture
Value in NeuroSphere is manifested through three "dialects":
* **ENPE (E-Coin):** The engine. Fixed supply of 100 Trillion. Used for staking (20%) and infrastructure growth.
* **LUV (Lovely Coin):** The social reward. Distributed via the E-KINDNESS algorithm (0-10 coins/day) to reward verified human kindness.
* **IND-EUR (IND Coin):** The anchor. An unlimited supply stablecoin pegged to real-world value, shielding local economies from speculation.

## 3. ARGI & Security Protocols
* **Self-Healing:** 3-second recovery cycle from decentralized snapshots.
* **Bankruptcy-Loop:** An exponential fee algorithm that drains attackers' capital upon detection of high-frequency anomalies.
* **Quantum Resilience:** Automated transition to Lattice-based cryptography.

## 4. Tokenomics & Lock Mechanism
* **Public/Donor Allocation:** 15% (Moveable for charity/deeds).
* **Emergency Pool:** 15% (Liquid for disasters).
* **Reserve & Ops:** 10% (Open for immediate use).
* **Locking:** General assets locked for 2 years; Founder's allocation locked for 3 years (minus 1% for the 1M People LUV program).

## 5. Evolution: From Money to Identity
After 12 months, the ecosystem evolves TM from "Technology Money" to a **"Living Value Identity."** NFTs will act as walking wallets, evolving visually based on social reputation (Aura Score) and inherited through secure, offline scannable protocols.
